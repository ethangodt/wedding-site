        We are thrilled to â€” <strong>FINALLY</strong> â€” be getting married and
        are excited to share our special day with close friends and family. The
        wedding will have a relaxed format that we hope will allow us to be more
        comfortable and together with the people we love. Weâ€™ve outlined many of
        the details below to help you understand our vision for the weekend. We
        canâ€™t wait to be dancing with you on the beach (and eating pizza)!

          We donâ€™t want to stuff the weekend full of planned events, but this
          calendar will evolve as we get closer to the weekend. Here is the
          general idea right now:

            >Stinson Beach</a
          >
          is a tiny beach town just north of San Francisco that we have always
          loved visiting. We have booked the entire
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aema09VDZkg" target="_blank">Willow Camp</a>
          property located near the ocean at Stinson Beach, CA. This property
          was built in 1917 and has hosted many storied figures such as Jerry
          Garcia, John Steinbeck, Al Capone, and soon â€” Ethan Godt (this is a
          bad Em joke). Thereâ€™s even a hidden speakeasy located on the property.
          Who will find it first?
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, you can easily spot whales during this time from the
          beach! Make sure to watch out for the waterspouts (and maybe a tail!)
          from migrating humpbacks.

        <h4>Driving In</h4>
        <p>
          Stinson Beach is about one hour from downtown San Francisco and thirty
          minutes from neighboring towns like Mill Valley (without traffic). By
          distance, it's not very far from the Bay Areaâ€™s major destinations,
          but because of the long stretch of two-lane winding roads, it can take
          more time than youâ€™d think to make it to Stinson. If you're not
          staying in Stinson for the weekend, make sure you've double-checked
          the drive time to Willow Camp.
        </p>

        <h4>Parking</h4>
        <p>
          There is limited parking at Willow Camp, which is reserved for guests
          staying with us on-site and wedding vendors. We will reach out to you
          if you should plan to park in the on-site lot.
          <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kkeGXaoZSiQ8Y5b66" target="_blank">
            There is a large parking lot </a
          >between the beach and Willow Camp that is just a five-minute walk
          away. We highly recommend carpooling if you can.

        </div>
        <p>
          Thank you for making the commitment to travel to the West Coast for
          us. Here is some info we hope will help make your travel decisions
          easier.
        </p>

        <h4>Flights</h4>

        <p>
          If youâ€™re flying in, either SFO or OAK are good options. Both are
          about 90 minutes from Stinson beach (without traffic).
        </p>

        <h4>Car Rental</h4>

        <p>
          If you're flying in, we recommend you rent a car or team up with other
          guests to share a rental. We donâ€™t advise trying to use public
          transportation or ride-sharing for the whole weekend. There are no
          train or bus lines that run to Stinson, and it can be challenging to
          match with an Uber or Lyft driver as it's removed from other towns by
          30 minutes of (beautiful) winding roads with spotty mobile data
          service.
        </p>

        <h4>Packing</h4>
        <p>
          As a tip for those flying in, packing clothes for the Bay Area can be
          unexpectedly challenging. The weather in the area floats between
          50-70, which means that things can start to feel a little warm during
          the day, and chilly at night. The key to success is
          <em><strong>layers</strong></em
          >. We highly recommend bringing a windbreaker with a hood (yes, even
          in July). Youâ€™ll also mostly want comfortable pants as opposed to
          shorts (though bringing <em>a</em> pair of shorts is a good idea). The
          ocean is not swimmable (unless youâ€™ve lost your gourd), but there will
          be a heated swimming pool so bring the necessary garb if youâ€™re
          interested in that.
        </p>

          While we love San Francisco, we recommend staying closer to the
          wedding venue if youâ€™re coming from out of town.

        <p>
          Some of our close family members and friends will be staying at Willow
          Camp in either the Lodge or the Carriage House. Across the road from
          Willow Camp is the beautiful
          <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pvLrrLwsw3svgsPdA" target="_blank"
            >Sandpiper Lodging Hotel</a
          >. This is the best option if you want to be as close as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://redwoodshaus.com/" target="_blank">Redwood Haus</a> is a small bed &
          breakfast and is also within walking distance to Willow Camp. This
          place is more rustic, very eclectic, but a bit cheaper than the
          Sandpiper. Because itâ€™s a bit of an unusual experience, we recommend
          you text us before making a reservation.

          If youâ€™re unable to stay in Stinson Beach, Mill Valley is about a
          thirty-minute drive away. We recommend the

          and will have a discount applied to your reservation there when you

          We have decided to hold a very small private ceremony with only our
          most immediate family members with a larger reception party in the
          afternoon and evening to celebrate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dress Code: Semi-Formal to Dressy-Casual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor-Cal summers on the beach can turn foggy and chilly pretty quickly.
          We will have some heating lamps scattered around, a bonfire, and some
          blankets to snuggle up with, but it never hurts to
          bring an extra layer! Feel free to bring a bathing suit if youâ€™d
          like to take a dip in the heated pool.
