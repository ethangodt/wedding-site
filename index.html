        We are thrilled to — <strong>FINALLY</strong> — be getting married and
        are excited to share our special day with close friends and family. The
        wedding will have a relaxed format that we hope will allow us to be more
        comfortable and together with the people we love. We can’t wait to be
        dancing with you on the beach (and eating pizza)!

          Our biggest hope for our wedding is that it be more full of relaxation
          and togetherness than stress and rushing around. We want the weekend
          to feel like an extended family reunion more than a traditional
          wedding.
        </p>

        <p>
          The calendar below has our plan for each day of the weekend. The
          Willow Camp property will be the main hub for activities, so feel free
          to stop by at any point you’re interested and available. In between
          the planned items we’ll be hanging at the heated pool, spending time
          on the beach, or just soaking in the stunning Willow Camp grounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          If there was a “main event” it would be the reception on Saturday.
          We’ll have drinks, catering, and a DJ. Bring dancing shoes and a
          hankering for woodfire pizza, the day will be bigger on those things
          than speeches and bouquet tosses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Earlier Saturday morning we’ll have the ceremony which will be private
          to the immediate family.
        </p>

            >Stinson Beach</a
          >
          is a tiny beach town just north of San Francisco that we have always
          loved visiting. We have booked the entire
          <a href="http://www.willow-camp.com/" target="_blank">Willow Camp</a>
          property located near the ocean. This property was built in 1917 and
          has hosted many storied figures such as Jerry Garcia, John Steinbeck,
          Al Capone, and soon — Ethan Godt (this is a bad Em joke). There’s even
          a hidden speakeasy located on the property. Who will find it first?
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, you can easily spot whales during this time from the
          beach! Make sure to watch out for the waterspouts (and maybe a tail!)
          from migrating humpbacks.

        <h4>Driving In</h4>
        <p>
          Stinson Beach is about one hour from downtown San Francisco and thirty
          minutes from neighboring towns like Mill Valley (without traffic). By
          distance, it's not very far from the Bay Area’s major destinations,
          but because of the long stretch of two-lane winding roads, it can take
          more time than you’d think to make it to Stinson. If you're not
          staying in Stinson for the weekend, make sure you've double-checked
          the drive time to Willow Camp.
        </p>

        <h4>Parking</h4>
        <p>
          There is limited parking at Willow Camp, which is reserved for guests
          staying with us on-site and wedding vendors. We will reach out to you
          if you should plan to park in the on-site lot.
          <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kkeGXaoZSiQ8Y5b66" target="_blank">
            There is a large parking lot </a
          >between the beach and Willow Camp that is just a five-minute walk
          away (no overnight parking though). We highly recommend carpooling if
          you can.

        </div>
        <p>
          Thank you for making the commitment to travel to the West Coast for
          us. Here is some info we hope will help make your travel decisions
          easier.
        </p>

        <h4>Flights</h4>

        <p>
          SFO or OAK are the nearest major airports. . Both are about 90 minutes
          from Stinson beach (without traffic).
        </p>

        <h4>Car Rental</h4>

        <p>
          If you're flying in, we recommend renting a car or teaming up with
          other guests to share a rental. We don’t advise trying to use public
          transportation or ride-sharing for the whole weekend. There are
          limited bus lines that run to Stinson, and it can be challenging to
          match with an Uber or Lyft driver as it's removed from other towns by
          30 minutes of (beautiful) winding roads with spotty mobile data
          service.
        </p>

        <h4>Packing</h4>
        <p>
          As a tip for those flying in, packing clothes for the Bay Area can be
          unexpectedly challenging. The weather in the area floats between
          50-70, which means that things can start to feel a little warm during
          the day, and chilly at night, especially when the fog rolls in. The
          key to success is <em><b>layers</b></em
          >. We highly recommend bringing sweaters and a jacket (yes, even in
          July). The ocean is not swimmable (unless you’ve lost your gourd), but
          there will be a heated swimming pool so bring the necessary garb if
          you’re interested in that.

          While we love San Francisco, we recommend staying closer to the
          wedding venue if you’re coming from out of town.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our close family members and friends will be staying at Willow
          Camp in either the Lodge or the Carriage House. Across the road from
          Willow Camp is the beautiful

            >Sandpiper Lodging Hotel</a

        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://redwoodshaus.com/" target="_blank">Redwood Haus</a>
          is a small bed & breakfast and is also within walking distance to
          Willow Camp. This place is more rustic, very eclectic, but a bit
          cheaper than the Sandpiper. Because it’s a bit of an unusual
          experience, we recommend you text us before making a reservation.
