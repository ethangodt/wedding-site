        Thank you so much to everyone for taking the time and spending the money
        to travel to the West Coast for us, we very much appreciate it! We
        decided to have our wedding here so that we could share the places we've
        loved in the beautiful Bay Area for the last 5+ years. We hope you enjoy
        it as much as we do!

          Thank you so much to everyone for taking the time and spending the
          money to travel to the West Coast for us, we very much appreciate it!
          We decided to have our wedding here so that we could share the places
          we've loved in the beautiful Bay Area for the last 5+ years. We hope
          you enjoy it as much as we do!
        </p>

        <h4>Flights</h4>

        <p>
          If youâ€™re flying in, either SFO or OAK are good options. Both are
          about 90 minutes from Stinson beach (without traffic).
        </p>

        <h4>Car Rental</h4>

        <p>
          If you're flying in we recommend you rent a car, or team up with other
          guests to share a rental. It's not advised to try to use public
          transportation or ride-sharing for the whole weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no train or bus lines that run to Stinson, and it can be
          difficult to match with an Uber/Lyft driver as it's removed from other
          towns by 30 minutes of (beautiful) winding roads.
        </p>

        <h4>Driving Expectations</h4>
        <p>
          Stinson Beach is about 1 hour from downtown San Francisco, and 30 min
          from neighboring towns like Mill Valley (without traffic). By distance
          it's not very far from the major destinations of the Bay Area, but
          because of the long stretch of two-lane winding roads it can take some
          time to make it all the way to Stinson. If you're not staying in
          Stinson for the weekend (no worries!) make sure you've double-checked
          the drive time to Willow
        </p>

        <p>
          The roads get windy as you approach Stinson Beach, as a caution for
          all those who suffer from motion sickness (Dramamine may be a good
          idea). That said, the view on the drive is worth it!
        </p>

        <h4>Parking</h4>
        <p>
          There is limited parking on the Willow Camp Grounds which we will be
          reserving for guests staying with us on-site and for the wedding
          vendors. There is a very large parking lot in between the beach and
          Willow Camp which is about a 5 minute walk away. We will not have a
          shuttle service but if you need assistance or have to park far away,
          we will have a dedicated person to come pick you up and bring you to
          the venue. We highly recommend carpooling if you can. While you might
          be able to get an Uber/Lyft to Stinson Beach, getting one to pick you
          up there is very difficult.

        </div>
        <p>
          Stinson Beach is a very small town with limited places to stay. As
          with a lot of places around the Bay Area, things tend to book up fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our close family members and friends will be staying at Willow
          Camp in either the Lodge or the Carriage House. Across the road from
          Willow Camp is the beautiful
          <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pvLrrLwsw3svgsPdA"
            >Sandpiper Lodging Hotel</a
          >. We are currently inquiring about room availability, but feel free
          to go ahead and reserve a room here if this is where you want to stay.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://redwoodshaus.com/">Redwood Haus</a> is a small B&B
          and is also *very* close to Willow Camp. This place is more rustic,
          very eclectic, but a bit cheaper than the Sandpiper. We would only
          recommend this to younger people who want to be close and donâ€™t mind a
          quirky experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also check out accommodations in Mill Valley (about a 30
          minute drive to Stinson Beach) such as the
          <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9PWsFXVrGApnqcuA7">Holiday Inn Express</a
          >, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Ty3qMGkqzo5HyyS47">Acqua Hotel</a>, or
          <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qgvfnhFroy7KN6Ck7"> Mill Valley Inn</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a lot of fun

        <p>
          You can also choose to stay in San Francisco which is about 45-60
          minutes away. If you would like recommendations on what areas to stay
          in SF, feel free to reach out to us!
